        <h3>
Hi, my name is Ramotse "Ramo" Phalatse. Over the past 18+ years I've relied on a blend of creative vision, collaboration and entrepreneurial resourcefulness to solve problems for businesses and the people they serve.
		</h3><p>
			I <strong>prioritise empathy and a learn-by-doing approach</strong>. This has led me to leadership roles across geographies, from co-founding a design studio serving multinational clients in South East Asia, Europe and Australia to accountability for strategic design initiatives at one of South Africa's largest banks.
			<br><br>
			I believe that design has a place in the boardroom, but that place must be earned by demonstrating the business impact of design.
