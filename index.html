        <p>
I’ve cultivated a blend of creative vision, entrepreneurial resourcefulness, and strategic acumen, over 15+ years of design and leadership experience, making me adept at delivering solutions that create human-centred value and capture business value. 
<br><br>
My ethos aligns with a holistic approach to education, life, and work, prioritising understanding, thought, and culture. This philosophy has led me to leadership roles across geographies, from co-founding a design studio serving high-end clients in South East Asia and Australia to spearheading strategic design initiatives at one of South Africa's largest banks.
<br><br>
I'm passionate about creativity, driving innovation, and bridging the gap between business goals and meaningful impact. As a lifelong learner and advocate for design, I'm always eager to push boundaries, embrace new challenges, and collaborate with like-minded co-conspirators for experience-led innovation.
