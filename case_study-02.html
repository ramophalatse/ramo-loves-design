			<h3>Objective</h3>
				<p>Build the "how" to accompany the "what" of our design process. Equip solution delivery teams with proven design methods to help them find Fit as they take innovation initiatives through Nedbank's delivery pipeline.</p>
				
				<h3>Role &amp; Responsibilities</h3>
				<p>I was accountable for the end-to-end delivery of this artefact and for orchestrating the efforts of my team and collaboration with stakeholders during development. I was also responsible for ensuring that the Toolkit, and its methods and outputs, are reflected in Nedbank's Agile delivery framework and that the latest version of the toolkit is readily accessible via our design community portal.</p>
				
				<h3>Approach &amp; Strategy</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Worked with various subject matter experts to identify fit-for-purpose design methods for inclusion.</li>
					<li>Applied Human-centred Design principles to the development of the Toolkit by interviewing colleagues across the business, synthesising learnings and iterating through the development of the toolkit.</li>
					<li>Gathered internal and external case studies to demonstrate "what good looks like" to secure buy-in and encourage inexperienced teams to apply the provided methods.</li>
					<li>Developed a continuous improvement roadmap based on feedback from frontline colleagues.</li>
					<li>Collaborated with <a href="https://miro.com" target="_blank">Miro</a> to embed Nedbank-designed templates into Miro's native template engine to ensure easy access to standardised templates.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Outcome &amp; Impact</h3>
				<p>Problem-Solution, Product-Market and Commercial Fit were adopted as mission-critical outcomes in Nedbank's "Golden Thread"–this is Nedbank's delivery framework and applies to all innovation initiatives across the enterprise. The stages of Fit feature as gateways against which additional funding and resource support is approved or declined.  </p>
