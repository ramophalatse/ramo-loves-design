			<h1>Project case study: Design Maturity Model</h1>
		<section id="intro">
			<div class="three">
				<h3>This Design Maturity Model exercise referenced several global design maturity studies to identify how Nedbank might mature its design practice and enhance the relevance, quality and commercial performance of its products and services. <!--This work was commissioned by the Executive Head of Design at Nedbank and foreshadowed a benchmarking initiative, facilitated by McKinsey (utilising the McKinsey Design Index) to equip our practice to deliver not just great, but differentiated experiences for our customers.--></h3>
				<hr>
				<h3>Objective</h3>
				<p>Determine strategy to elevate Nedbank Design from an established design practice to a differentiated one.</p>
				
				<h3>Role &amp; Responsibilities</h3>
				<p>I was tasked by Nedbank's Executive Head of Design to examine global frameworks/maturity standards, identify gaps in our design organisation's maturity and propose key strategic focus areas and initiatives to mature our practice.</p>
				
				<h3>Approach &amp; Strategy</h3>
				<p>I cross-referenced two of the largest global design maturity studies conducted to date to determine opportunities, risks as they relate to Nedbank. I summarised three key takeouts from a study surveying 2,200 organisations and translated those into four strategic goals substantiated by the business uplift we could expect to see across specific measures.</p>
				
				<h3>Outcome &amp; Impact</h3>
				<p>This project drew attention to the inflection point we stood at and foreshadowed a piece of work currently underway with McKinsey to equip our design practice to deliver not just great, but differentiated experiences for our customers and returns for our organisation.</p>
